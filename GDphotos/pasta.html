                      <h2>Value of a Dollar</h2>
                      <p>For this assignment we had to take 50 items that <br> 
                    were a dollar or less and categorize them seven different <br> 
                    ways. I like pasta so i took 50 different types of pasta  <br> 
                    and catagorized them by price, shape, container type,  <br>
                    Whether or not they come with sauce, Whether or not they <br>
                    are microwavable, Which ones I've had, and what store <br>
                    they came from. It was a long process but it was <br>
                    worth it!
